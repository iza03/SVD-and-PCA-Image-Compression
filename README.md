# SVD-and-PCA-Image-Compression
• Implemented in Matlab

• The images are black and white and are represented with a matrix

• The reduced singular value decomposition means elimination of zero eigenvalues or a very small value from
the matrix S, from the SVD (representing the less significant information)

• The result is an approximate image that has almost all the information stored by the original image, but
only kept in memory in a more limited form.

• The PCA compression is done using an algorithm based on the covariance matrix
